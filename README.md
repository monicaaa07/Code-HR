# Project Title
Hacker Rank Practice Kit - Solved!

# Description
This Project has (almost) all questions in the Hacker Rank interview kit solved    
It contains only code snippets. Cannot be executed on local after cloning.    

The code snippets committed are as follows:

1) greedyFlorist.py :    
* Complete the getMinimumCost function.  
The florist  decides he'll multiply the price of each flower by the number of that customer's previously purchased flowers plus . The first flower will be original price, , the next will be  and so on.

* Given the size of the group of friends, the number of flowers they want to purchase and the original prices of the flowers, determine the minimum cost to purchase all of the flowers. It should return the minimum cost to purchase all of the flowers.

* getMinimumCost has the following parameter(s):  
c: an array of integers representing the original price of each flower  
k: an integer, the number of friends

2) luckbalance.py  
L[i] is the amount of luck associated with a contest. If Lena wins the contest, her luck balance will decrease by L[i]; if she loses it, her luck balance will increase by .  
T[i] denotes the contest's importance rating. It's equal to 1 if the contest is important, and it's equal to 0 if it's unimportant.
If Lena loses no more than k important contests, what is the maximum amount of luck she can have after competing in all the preliminary contests? This value may be negative.

3) maxMin.py  
Given a list of integers,arr , and a single integer k , create an array arr' of length k from elements of  such that max(arr') -min(arr') is minimized.

arr = [1,4,2,7];
k = 2;
Solution = [1,2]

4) Pairs.py  
Given an array of integers and a target value, determine the number of pairs of array elements that have a difference equal to the target value.

Example
k = 1;
arr = [1,2,3,4]  
There are three values that differ by k: 2-1, 3-2, and 4-3. Return 3.
